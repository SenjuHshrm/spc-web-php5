                <h4 class="mt-0 font-weight-bold" style="color:3490DC;">History of San Pablo City</h4>
                  <p>
                    The earliest historical record of the City of San Pablo dates
                      back to pre-Spanish times when four (4) big barrios bounded by Mt. Banahaw
                      and Mt. Makiling composed Sampaloc.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In 1521, Sampaloc was changed to San Pablo De Los Montes, which became
                  a parish in 1556 and then a municipality in 1647.  In 1899, a Municipal
                  Government was established with Inocente Martinez as Municipal President
                  in 1902 when the Civil Government was granted independence from the Province
                  of Laguna.  On May 7, 1940, the charter bill sponsored by Congressman Tomas
                  Dizon was approved.  The bill became known as the City Charter of San Pablo
                  or Commonwealth Act No. 520. The City was inaugurated on March 30, 1941 with Dr.
                  Potenciano Malvar as the appointed City Mayor.

  <p> In ancient times, San Pablo was known as the village of Sampalok.
        It was an upland realm surrounded by mountain ranges and quiescent volcanic peaks.
        Belief was that mountain making movements or orogeny  had thrust lower lying areas
        to uplands and low rolling plains after extensive volcanisms took place millions of
        years ago and  where caesal piniaceus tamarind  or sampalok trees grew  in wild
        abundance. This upland realm became our hometown, San Pablo de los Montes.</p>
<hr/>
        <h5 class="mt-0 font-weight-bold" style="color:3490DC;">History of Sampalok Lake</h5>
        <p> Sampalok was a large and prospering village which had its own system of government
        and culture. Barangays already existed and each was headed by a chieftain who
        was also known as  Gatpuno. Foremost among them were Gat Paguil, Gat Sungayan,
        Gat Salakab and Gat Pulintan.  Cultural development was manifested in marriage
        patterns, religion and social groups. </p><p>
        Even crude written symbols of communications
        were used to record simple trades and forms of literature although oral handing of
        customs, beliefs, songs and practices was preferred. The natives had a glimpse of
        the outside world thru Chinese traders who were the first group to be in contact
        with as evidenced by  ceramic pieces  that were unearthed and carbon-dated.</p>
<hr/>
<h5 class="mt-0 font-weight-bold" style="color:3490DC;">Spaniards Era</h5>
        <p>In search of gold the first Spanish troops under Captain Juan de Salcedo reached
        the upland realm of Sampalok in 1571 and immediately announced governance in
        the name of the king of Spain. Administration of its affairs was turned over to
        the   Augustinian missionaries who succeeded in converting most of the natives
        to Christianity.</p><p>
      Fiesta was introduced as part of religious rituals.  Consequently,
        some barangay villages were renamed after saints as a reason for the festivity.
        Native chieftains were renamed cabesa de barangay and in 1647 Sampalok was renamed
        San Pablo de los Montes in honor of St. Paul the First Hermit and became an independent
        municipality with a gobernadorcillo or capitan as its head.</p>
<hr/>
<h5 class="mt-0 font-weight-bold" style="color:3490DC;">American Era</h5>
        <p>The subsequent defeat of the Spanish colonizers set the stage for another war – the
Filipino-American war and the inevitable American occupation and establishment of
the Philippine Commonwealth. Although Manila was captured by the American troops on
June 30, 1898 the first American cavalry arrived in San Pablo on January 14, 1900
after taking Santa Cruz and Calamba earlier and routed the  local freedom fighters.</p><p>
America’s pacification drive and grant of amnesty to freedom-fighters did much to
quell animosity and distrust among the local citizenry and on January 24, 1901 U.S.
military authorities appointed Don Pedro de Gorostiza as municipal president of San
Pablo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Civil government in the Philippines was inaugurated on July 4, 1901.
          It was ushered in locally by the elite of San Pablo  which was composed of the
          influential, wealthy and closely related families  who easily dominated the fledgling
          electoral process.
  </p>

  <hr/>
  <h5 class="mt-0 font-weight-bold" style="color:3490DC;">Japanese Era</h5>
          <p>In the morning of December 25, 1941 Japanese fighter planes dropped bombs in the city
        and strafed people and edifices. They left behind a harrowing scene of ruins and death.
        On December 30, 1941 General Susuma  Morioka arrived and took over San Pablo in the name
        of the invading Japanese Imperial Forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      World War II brought extensive damage to the city in terms of lives lost and property
        destroyed. It brought out the worst and the best in men – from the dreaded notoriety
        of the local kempetai and makapili collaborators  to the admirable heroism of the local
        guerillas and freedom fighters one of whom was Cipriano B. Colago who became the first elected
        City Mayor of San Pablo. Japanese occupation ended when the American troops marched into
        the city on April 4, 1945.
